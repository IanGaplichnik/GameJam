This project was done as a part of Game Jam event at Hive Helsinki school.

The idea of the project was to build a game in 48 hours. Our team has decided to choose a language, nobody has experience using, and we decided to take Javascript.
The result game can be run in browser at <a href="https://ladymarengo.github.io/">(https://ladymarengo.github.io/).
