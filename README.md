# No Way Out?

This project was done as a part of Game Jam event at Hive Helsinki school.

The idea of the project was to build a game in 48 hours. Our team has decided to choose a language, nobody has experience using, and we decided to take Javascript.
The result game can be run in browser at <a href="https://ladymarengo.github.io/">https://ladymarengo.github.io/.

## Concept
  Player's character has to run forward, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. It is a very well-known concept and the game is basically endless. However, over time, the speed will increase, making it more difficult to play.
  
## Controls
  Player has access to 2 moves - pressing "Up arrow" will make the character to jump and "Down arrow" will flip the map! If you are facing an obstacle, which is too high to jump over, use the "Down arrow", and the obstacle will be flipped to the other side of the map
